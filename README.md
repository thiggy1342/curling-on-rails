# Curling On Rails
I've been looking around for a curling club manager that really fit our club's needs, and haven't found one that quite works to date. This application will start out as a simple league manager, and from there I aim to add functionality for spiels/friendlies, as well as a "storefront" to handle member and league signups. Much more to come!
